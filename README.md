# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `MVP`

This app can be broken down to two main sections that you'll need to implement for this project: the Search Bar and the Posts.
To complete this project there will be a single instance of the Search Bar being rendered at the top of the page, as well as a Posts component that renders an individual Post for every object inside the dummy-data.js array.
Use what you learned yesterday to set up state to keep track of the posts.
You will implement a callback to increase the "likes count" on posts, and hand it through props several levels down into a nested component.
Look through the code before you start. There are a lot of files. Not all of them need code added to them. Start in the App.js file and read the instructions there.
